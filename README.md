This script adds a button to the top right bar (next to chat & participant list) to enable grid-view in Google Meets. Grid view gives every participant an equal sized video for use in meetings without a primary speaker (such as working from home silent meetings).

This script forcibly loads every participant's video when grid view is enabled and may cause performance issues in extremely large meetings.
