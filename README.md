## UPDATE 02/11/2021:
It turns out that Google is testing an update of Meet that disables the Grid View extension. This is why sometimes it works and sometimes not (you see the boxes in a vertical bar). If you seriously need Grid View right now, you might consider refreshing a few times the browser tab (you should end up loading the old compatible version at a certain point).

I am really sorry but I have to temporarily remove the extension from Chrome Web Store. In fact, updating Grid View would require a huge amount of work or may not be feasible at all. Please, remember that Google Meet introduced native grid view (up to 49 tiles).

### Offline installation
[Here](https://github.com/icysapphire/google-meet-grid-view/releases/download/1.41/grid-view.zip) you can find a ZIP archive containing the extension. Please uncompress it, then:

1. Navigate to "chrome://extensions/" in the url bar...
2. Click "Developer mode" in the top right hand corner.
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder you have just unzipped

It should work.

===================

This extension adds a button to the top right bar (next to chat & participant list) to enable grid-view in Google Meets. Grid view gives every participant an equal sized video for use in meetings without a primary speaker (such as working from home silent meetings).

This extension forcibly loads every participant's video when grid view is enabled and may cause performance issues in extremely large meetings.

Includes a variety of options to enhance your meeting: include your own video, highlight who is speaking, and hide participants without video!
